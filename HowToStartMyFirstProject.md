# How to start with my first fischertechnik SLI project?

We saw in [How to setup my Eclipse workspace?](./HowToStartWithFtTxtWorkspace.md)   how we were able to prepare eclipse start for the real thing: creating, compiling and testing of programs for the TXT.<br/>
Now we are going to compile and run a SLI and setup our first new SLI.
We will also see how to track and analyze the progress of an ongoing RoboPro program using an SLI with Putty and Notepad ++

The support this SLI introduction you will find a set of projects with the name `TxtSharedLibraryInterface`in the `FtTxtWorkspace`. 
[The FtTxtWorkspace README](./FtTxtWorkspace/README.md)

## `TxtSharedLibraryInterface`
`TxtSharedLibraryInterface` is about the basics:
- compiling
- installing
- using in a RoboPro programming
- tracing with Putty and consultation of the trace log with Notepad++, [See also](.//README.md#howtracelog)
- tracing with SPDlog.

The 'TxtDeps` root contains a README.me about the instruction of how to make use of these libraries and includes in your projects

Each root  of the following projects contains a README.md with the detail, description  and instructions for that project
### `TxtSharedLibraryInterface`

`TxtSharedLibraryInterface` is about the basics.

### `TxtSharedLibraryInterface2`

`TxtSharedLibraryInterface2` is about the on-line 5 sec problem.

### `TxtSharedLibraryInterface3`

`TxtSharedLibraryInterface3` the blocking problem.

### `TxtSharedLibraryInterfaceDemo01`

 `TxtSharedLibraryInterfaceDemo01`is about the use of the TA (`transfer area`)
 
 
### `TxtSharedLibraryInterfaceDemo02`

 `TxtSharedLibraryInterfaceDemo02` is about the use of an encoder motor
### `TxtMyProject`

Is about creating the start code for your first project.

## Adding projects to this `FtTxtWorkspace`
Later you can add more new projects or projects from others into this `FtTxtWorkspace`.
It is also possible to have both SLI and executable projects in this `FtTxtWorkspace`. Both are using the same `FtxDeps`project and `LinaroMap` Environment variable. Only the 'asset' different.
- Add an existing Eclipse TXT project to this workspace.
  Copy that relevant project into the `FtTxtWorkspace` and use the Eclipse menu `file|Import` to add this project to the workspace. **Check if the project properties are fine!** 
  
- Create a new project by copying an existing one.
  Select the project, which you prefer to copy, in the`FtTxtWorkspace`.<br/>
  Go with the right mouse button to the properties and select `Copy`.<br/>
  Go with the right mouse button to the properties and select `Past`.<br/>
  You will see a popup-box with the question for a new name. Fill the name for your project in. Press the `Copy` button.<br/>
  Check the project properties of the `C/C++ General`| `Paths and Symbols`  for the includes are fine. Probably you will need to change some paths.<br/>
  Clean the `src` file and start with coding. 
- How the create a new SLI project from scratch has been describe in:   [Project setup from scratch](./ProjectSetUp(so).md) 

That is all folks, have fun and success with your proper SLI's and/or executables.
